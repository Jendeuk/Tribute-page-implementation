Usually I would have used either flexbox or grid to display the content of html documents.
But for this instance I find it unecessary as the content is quite small in size and thus
the sketch and design I have chosen for this solution is also quite simple. Therefore,
I focused on minmialistic modern design and finds that the elements displayed as a block were
good enough for this. This resulted in a very clean css file.
