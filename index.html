        <p>
          Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee (born 8 June 1955), also known as TimBL,
          is an English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the
          World Wide Web. He is a Professorial Fellow of Computer Science at the
          University of Oxford and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
          Technology (MIT). Berners-Lee proposed an information management
          system on 12 March 1989, then implemented the first successful
          communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and

        <h2>Career and research</h2>
        <p>
          Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN from June to
          December 1980. While in Geneva, he proposed a project based on the
          concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information
          among researchers.To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named
          ENQUIRE.
        </p>
        <p>
          Berners-Lee wrote his proposal in March 1989 and, in 1990,
          redistributed it. It then was accepted by his manager, Mike Sendall,
          who called his proposals "vague, but exciting". He used similar ideas
          to those underlying the ENQUIRE system to create the World Wide Web,
          for which he designed and built the first web browser. His software
          also functioned as an editor (called WorldWideWeb, running on the
          NeXTSTEP operating system), and the first Web server, CERN HTTPd
          (short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol daemon).
        </p>
        <p>
          Berners-Lee published the first web site, which described the project
          itself, on 20 December 1990; it was available to the Internet from the
          CERN network. The site provided an explanation of what the World Wide
          Web was, and how people could use a browser and set up a web server,
          as well as how to get started with your own website. On 6 August 1991,
          Berners-Lee first posted, on Usenet, a public invitation for
          collaboration with the WorldWideWeb project.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the W3C at the Massachusetts Institute of
          Technology. The World Wide Web Consortium decided that its standards
          should be based on royalty-free technology, so that they easily could
          be adopted by anyone.
